## Summary

What is more important in life than cats or dogs? That's right, nothing. The Petful app is designed to pair hypothetical cats and dogs with hypothetical owners in a simulation of real life akin to the depth and realism of Cyberpunk 2077. The user enters the site ready to adopt a cat or dog. After perusing the adoption process with a fine toothed comb, the user will get in line. The anticipation while in line is stifling, as the user is subjected to seeing Fidos and Garfields leaping into the arms of their new masters left and right. Finally, after exactly 15 seconds of waiting, the user hits the front of the line and must make the most important decision of their lives. Cat? Dog? Today... is a dog day. The user clicks the 'Adopt me!' button to meet their new best friend. Afterwards, five prospective users file in to fill the line back to full. 

What a wonderful day for the user. Petful: Where Dreams Come True.
